                <p>The death of <a href="https://heavy.com/news/2018/03/elaine-herzberg-killed-uber-self-driving" target="_blank" id="tribute-link">Elaine Herzberg</a> (August 2, 1968 â€“ March 18, 2018) was the first recorded case of a pedestrian fatality involving a self-driving (autonomous) car, following a collision that occurred late in the evening of March 18, 2018. Herzberg was pushing a bicycle across a four-lane road in Tempe, Arizona, United States, when she was struck by an Uber taxi, which was operating in self-drive mode with a human safety backup driver sitting in the driving seat. Following the collision, Herzberg was taken to the hospital where she died of her injuries.</p>
                <p>As a result of the fatal incident, Uber immediately suspended testing of self-driving vehicles in Arizona, where such testing had been welcomed since August 2016. Uber also decided not to renew its permit for autonomous vehicle testing in California when it expired at the end of March 2018.</p>
                <p>Herzberg was specifically the first pedestrian death involving a self-driving car; a previous fatality, in which the driver of a semi-autonomous car was killed, had occurred almost two years prior. A Washington Post reporter compared Herzberg's fate with that of Bridget Driscoll who, in the United Kingdom in 1896, was the first pedestrian to be killed by an automobile.</p>
